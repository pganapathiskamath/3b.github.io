    <h5 class="cad-title">Rolls-Royce Phantom</h5>
    <p class="card-text">The car is an all-aluminium spaceframe chassis which is loosely related to that of its predecessor. Rolls-Royce says that it is lighter in weight and 30 per cent stiffer than before, traits that make the new Phantom more efficient. The British luxury carmaker has also confirmed that the platform will underpin its first-ever SUV, the Cullinan, and the next generation models of the Wraith, Dawn and the Ghost. Rolls-Royce says that none of its cars, in the future, will have a monocoque construction either. It is powered by a twin-turbo 6.75-litre V12 engine that produces 571PS of power and 900Nm of torque. The engine is turned to deliver all of its torque at revs as low as 1,700. The eight-speed auto does its job well and although the Phantom VIII weighs over 2.6-tonnes, it can hit 100kmph in 5.4 seconds and clock a top speed of 250kmph.

Like its predecessor, the Silver Cloud was built on a box-steel chassis allowing customers to order custom-tailored bodies like the rare cabriolets made by H.J. Mulliner.Many cars were built with standard bodywork from the Rolls-Royce factory that used a standard steel body shell fabricated by Pressed Steel Company Limited.

The central division has a cocktail cabinet, with the provision to hold a refrigerated ice bucket as well as cocktail glasses and a mixer bottle. These are all tucked behind a wooden door which when folded down forms a table for the passengers.
